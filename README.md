<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The Bubble Game Project consists of the following key components:</p>

1. HTML Structure
The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the game:

It includes a play area where bubbles appear.
The top bar displays the player's score, hit value, and the remaining time.

2. CSS Styling
The CSS stylesheet (style.css) provides the visual styling for the game:

  It defines the appearance of bubbles, buttons, and other elements.
  The game's layout is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly.
  Responsive design ensures the game adapts to different screen sizes.

3. JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code (style.js) adds game logic and interactivity:

   Bubbles are dynamically generated and displayed on the screen.
   Players need to click on bubbles with a specific hit value to earn points.
   A timer counts down the remaining time, and the game ends when time runs out.
   The player's score is calculated and displayed at the end of the game.

Incorporating sound effects or music for a more immersive experience.
Implementing a leaderboard to track high scores.
Enhancing the game's graphics and animations.
